## Introduction

  Just a classic game of Tic-tac-toe.....or is it? Your characters are knighted squirrels that go by Sir Squeaken the Oak and Sir Floofintail of Nuttingham. Each player has a battle token to defend themselves in the game board arena. Click each space on the board to claim it and place your token. Get three in a row, column, or diagonally and your squirrel will officially be dubbed winner of the battle.

## Technologies
